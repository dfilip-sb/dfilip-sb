- 👋 Hi, I’m @dfilip-sb, it's my special GitHub account for the organization.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, engineering, and automation.
- 🌱 I’m working in a wonderful Savings team at Shawbrook Bank (London).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applications for data processing/migration/analysis.
- 📫 In SB you already know how to reach me =)
- 🐧 BTW, deep in my soul, I'm a Linuxoid, and it's a pleasure for me that MS recommends using Linux, for years already. Despite they continue to carry the boring legacy of Windows.
